        <p>Welcome to the JSWarrior Game. Unlike traditional games, you can't control your character through a keyboard or joystick. The only way you can control your character is through JavaScript. To beat JSWarrior you can't just mash buttons, you need to think up a strategy and program the strategy as a JavaScript function.</p>
        <p>But what's the point? Sure you will probably get a great intellectual thrill of having programmed some primitive AI within 30 minutes. But if you complete JSWarrior you get a real reward!</p>
        <div class="alert alert-success">
        <p>If you complete JSWarrior, and show it to us at the FusionCharts stall in JSFoo 2013, we'll give you a cookie!! This is because you're just that awesome.</p>
