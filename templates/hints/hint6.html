<h3>Level 6</h3>
<p>You are in the middle of the room. Captives behind you, enemies ahead.</p>
<p>You can check what's behind you with <code>warrior.check('backward')</code> and walk backward with <code>warrior.walk('backward')</code>, etc. Remember that archers have a limited range, and if you're low on health, retreat until you can recover it. </p>
