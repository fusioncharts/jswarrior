<h3>Level 4</h3>
<p>You hear a disgruntled noise. It's the sound of a JavaLiner, a monster who hates the jsWarrior and throws java-lins at you from a distance.</p>
<p>Be sure to not rest when you're taking damage. You can save data like <code>warrior.some_variable = 'some value';</code>. Use this to see if you're continuing to take damage while healing.</p>
