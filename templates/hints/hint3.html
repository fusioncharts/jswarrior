<h3>Level 3</h3>
<p>You wander into another room. But this room is filled with Trolls. They are stronger than orcs, but still can't move or attack beyond one step.</p>
<p>You can't take on all the Trolls without dying. Instead, you can call <code>warrior.getHealth()</code> to see your health (maximum of 20 points), and you can call the <code>warrior.rest()</code> action to rest for a turn heal 2 points.</p>
